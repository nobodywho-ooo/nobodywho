# Installation
_How to install NobodyWho and get started with the plugin._ 

---



Install NobodyWho for the platform of your choice.

### Via Asset Library:

=== ":simple-godotengine: Godot"

    - Open Godot 4.4
    - Go to the "Asset Library" tab in the top of the editor
    - Search for "NobodyWho"
    - Click on it
    - Click "Download"
    - Make sure "Ignore asset root" is checked
    - Click "Install"

    This should install NobodyWho in `res://addons/nobodywho`, and you should now be able to see the NobodyWho nodes (e.g. `NobodyWhoChat`) in Godot.

    You may need to restart Godot.


=== ":simple-unity: Unity"

    Nobodywho  unity has not yet come to the asset store ðŸ« 

    Please see the section below for how to install it untill then.


### Via Github

=== ":simple-godotengine: Godot"

    Grab a specific version from our github releases pages [github releases page.](https://github.com/nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho/releases) (we recomend the latest). 
    You can install these zip files by going to the "AssetLib" tab in Godot and selecting "Import".
    OBS: Make sure that the ignore asset root option is set in the import dialogue.


=== ":simple-unity: Unity"

    Grab the latest- or a specific version from the [github releases page.](https://github.com/nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho/releases)
    When you download the unity package file, make sure to follow https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackagesImport.html to import the asset. 

    Basically ensure that you import it like this: `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`

    To see and play around with the samples you might need to right click the plugin and then: `> View in Package Manager > Click on NobodyWho > Samples > Install`. This should set up all the dependencies correctly.
    From there you can also check the documentaiton.



NobodyWho should now be avialable in your editor of choice. 

Before moving on please ensure that you have access to the correct nodes

### TODO: add images to ensure people understand where to look for the correct nodes. ###
