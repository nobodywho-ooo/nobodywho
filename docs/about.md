# About Us

## Who We Are

**ARTificial Mind** is a Copenhagen-based art-tech studio founded by Cecilie Waagner Falkenstr√∏m. Over eight years, we've built and deployed LLM-powered systems ranging from real-time interactive installations with embedded system to long-running production grade applications.

Through dozens of projects involving natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI, we consistently hit the same roadblock: working with large language models meant choosing between complex, fragmented local tools or cloud services that harvest your data and lock you into proprietary ecosystems.

We've spent years dealing with the pain points of local AI deployment - from building interactive AI-systems and finetuning to inference optimization and multiagent setups. We built NobodyWho because we got tired of solving the same infrastructure problems over and over again.

## Why This Matters

AI is getting more centralized every day. The most powerful models live behind APIs, your data flows through corporate servers, and you're stuck with whatever pricing and policies they decide.
But the most interesting applications happen when you have full control - when you can experiment freely, keep data private, and build exactly what you need without compromise.

We want every developer to have access to powerful AI without the usual trade-offs. Build applications that respect privacy, run reliably, effortlessly scale and adapt to your exact requirements.

**NobodyWho** is our contribution to that issue.

## Join the Community

We're building tools that put developers first and grow stronger through community contribution, so if you want to help; Hop by our Discord or drop a PR on our Github - we would love to have you involved.

We are always open to talented people - so if you have experience in rust and the LLM-space feel free to contact us on services@artificalmind.ai.
