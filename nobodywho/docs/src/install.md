# Installation

_Work in progress â€” describe how to obtain dependencies, build, and run NobodyWho here._ 


<!-- langtabs-start -->

    ### Via the Godot Asset Library:

    - Open Godot 4.4
    - Go to the "Asset Library" tab in the top of the editor
    - Search for "NobodyWho"
    - Click on it
    - Click "Download"
    - Make sure "Ignore asset root" is checked
    - Click "Install"

    This should install NobodyWho in `res://addons/nobodywho`, and you should now be able to see the NobodyWho nodes (e.g. `NobodyWhoChat`) in Godot.

    You may need to restart Godot.
